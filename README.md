# NBAi-Proj
NBA Statistics Project[GROUP PROJECT]

Project was to create an algorithm using public Machine Learning tools to analyze NBA player statistics, and then use the analysis to predict team outcomes for the upcoming year. This was to be then to be used within a easily navigated user site.

## Initial research.

I managed to get some vaguely helpful data from BigML.com through cleaning and weighting the data.
[Basic Data Model](https://bigml.com/shared/model/06nDeA0N4NWFeQU0z1w5FsexU5o)

## Backend

The backend was initially done by another group member however it was hosted in their Azure Portal and deleted before the second stage of the project. So I recreated it using entity framework. I added autogenerated IDs and unique constraints to the Team Name field.

## Frontend

Done in React JS
A team member initially created the data tables using data mapping. I went through and changed some minor issues, adding and subtracting players to personal team. Played with checkboxes etc.

I also set up the projects CICD pipelines.
